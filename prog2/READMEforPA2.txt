-- README for PA2--

In order to run this program, you must complete the following steps: 

1.) After unzipping the file (unzip followed by name of the zip file), there should be a total of 6 files present altogether:

	Files needed to execute: 

		* prog2_1.jar
		* pageref.txt
	
	Individual files

		* Clock.java
		* ClockIterator.java
		* Page.java
		* Page Replacement.java

2.) In order to execute prog2, cd into prog 2 directory and then specify needed arguments such as memory size, input page, hit cost, swap-in cost time, and swap-out cost time. Your command should look like this: 

 --> java -jar PRA.jar clock 20 pageref.txt 1 10 20

3.) Output should be displayed via class server command line.

4.) Individual files of code for viewing are included for code review.
