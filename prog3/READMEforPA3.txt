-- README for PA2--

In order to run this program, you must complete the following steps: 

1.) After unzipping the file (unzip followed by name of the zip file), there should be a total of 3 files present altogether:

	Files needed to execute: 

		* prog3.jar
		* requests.txt
	
	Individual files

		* diskAlgo.java
		* disk.java
		

2.) In order to execute prog3, cd into prog3 directory and then specify the algorithm, total blocks, and the specific block you wish to work with. For example: 

 --> java -jar prog3.jar 53 200 fcfs requests.txt 

will specify the program to start at block 53 with 200 blocks in total using the text file requests.txt. 


3.) Output should be displayed via class server command line.

4.) Individual files of code for viewing are included for code review.
